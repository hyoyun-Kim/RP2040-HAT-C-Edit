## Development environment configuration

To test the ethernet examples, the development environment must be configured to use Raspberry Pi Pico.

The ethernet examples were tested by configuring the development environment for **Windows**. Please refer to the '**9.2. Building on MS Windows**' section of '**Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico**' document below and configure accordingly.

- [**Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico**][link-getting_started_with_raspberry_pi_pico]

**Visual Studio Code** was used during development and testing of ethernet examples, the guide document in each directory was prepared also base on development with Visual Studio Code. Please refer to corresponding document.

- **Add Cmake Configure Environment Value**

1. Open Cmake Tools Extension Settings
2. Add Cmake: Configure Environment Item as PICO_SDK_PATH
3. ADD Cmake: Configure Environment Valuse as 'D:/RP2040/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/pico-sdk'

## Hardware requirements

The ethernet examples use **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **WIZnet Ethernet HAT** - ethernet I/O module built on WIZnet's [**W5100S**][link-w5100s] ethernet chip or **W5100S-EVB-Pico** - ethernet I/O module built on [**RP2040**][link-rp2040] and WIZnet's [**W5100S**][link-w5100s] ethernet chip.

<a name="ethernet_example_structure"></a>
## Ethernet example structure

Examples are available at '**RP2040-HAT-C/examples/**' directory. As of now, following examples are provided.

- [**DHCP & DNS**][link-dhcp_dns]
- [**FTP**][link-ftp]
	- [**Client**][link-ftp_client]
	- [**Server**][link-ftp_server]
- [**HTTP**][link-http]
	- [**Server**][link-http_server]
- [**Loopback**][link-loopback]
- [**MQTT**][link-mqtt]
	- [**Publish**][link-mqtt_publish]
	- [**Subscribe**][link-mqtt_subscribe]
- [**SNTP**][link-sntp]
- [**TCP Client over SSL**][link-tcp_client_over_ssl]

Note that **ioLibrary_Driver**, **mbedtls**, **pico-sdk**, **pico-extras** are needed to run ethernet examples. 

1. **ioLibrary_Driver** library is applicable to WIZnet's W5x00 ethernet chip.

2. **mbedtls** library supports additional algorithms and support related to TLS and SSL connections. 

3. **pico-sdk** is made available by Pico to enable developers to build software applications for the Pico Platform. 

4. **pico-extras** has additional libraries that are not yet ready for inclusion the Pico SDK proper, or are just useful but don't necessarily belong in the Pico SDK.

   Libraries are located in the '**RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/**' directory.

- [**ioLibrary_Driver**][link-ioLibrary_driver]
- [**mbedtls**][link-mbedtls_library]
- [**pico-sdk**][link-pico_sdk]
- [**pico-extras**][link-pico_extras]

If you want to modify the code that MCU-dependent and use a MCU other than **RP2040**, you can modify it in the **port** directory.

port is located in the '**RP2040-HAT-C/port/**' directory.

- [**ioLibrary_Driver**][link-ioLibrary_driver_port]
- [**mbedtls**][link-mbedtls_port]
- [**timer**][link-timer_port]

The structure of this **RP2040-HAT-C 2.0.0** version has changed a lot compared to the previous version. If you want to refer to the previous version, please refer to the link below.

- [**RP2040-HAT-C 1.0.0 version**][link-RP2040-HAT-C_1.0.0_version]

## Ethernet example testing

1. Download

If the ethernet examples are cloned, the library set as a submodule is an empty directory. Therefore, if you want to download the library set as a submodule together, clone the ethernet examples with the following Git command.

```cpp
/* Change directory */
// change to the directory to clone
cd [user path]

// e.g.
cd D:/RP2040

/* Clone */
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Wiznet/RP2040-HAT-C.git
```

With Visual Studio Code, the library set as a submodule is automatically downloaded, so it doesn't matter whether the library set as a submodule is an empty directory or not, so refer to it.

2. Patch

With Visual Studio Code, each library set as a submodule is automatically patched, but if you do not use Visual Studio Code, each library set as a submodule must be manually patched with the Git commands below in each library directory.

- ioLibrary_Driver

```cpp
/* Change directory */
// change to the 'ioLibrary_Driver' library directory
cd [user path]/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/ioLibrary_Driver

// e.g.
cd D:/RP2040/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/ioLibrary_Driver

/* Patch */
git apply ../../patches/01_ethernet_chip.patch
git apply ../../patches/02_ftp_client.patch
```

3. Test

Please refer to 'README.md' in each example directory to find detail guide for testing ethernet examples.



## How to use port directory

- We moved the MCU dependent code to the port directory. The tree of port is shown below. 

```
 
  RP2040-HAT-C  
  ┣ port
     ┣ ioLibrary_Driver
     ┃ ┣ w5x00_spi.c
     ┃ ┗ w5x00_spi.h
     ┣ mbedtls
     ┃ ┗ inc
     ┃ ┃ ┗ ssl_config.h
     ┣ timer
     ┃ ┣ timer.c
     ┃ ┗ timer.h
     ┣ CMakeLists.txt
     ┣ port_common.h
     ┗ version.h
```

- **ioLibrary_Driver**

  If you want to change things related to SPI, such as the SPI port number and SPI read/write function, or use a different MCU without using the RP2040, you need to change the code in the 'RP2040-HAT-C/port/ioLibrary_Driver/' directory.

- **timer**

  This version is a structure that registers a callback function in the **wizchip_1ms_timer_initialize** function. So, you can modify the code to be executed in the **repeating_timer_callback** function in the main.
  Such as here is a example code in the 'RP2040-HAC-C/examples/dhcp_dns/w5x00_dhcp_dns.c'.

  ```
  /* Initialize */
  wizchip_1ms_timer_initialize(repeating_timer_callback);
  
  /* Timer */
  void repeating_timer_callback(void)
  {
      g_msec_cnt++;
  
      if (g_msec_cnt >= 1000 - 1)
      {
          g_msec_cnt = 0;
  
          DHCP_time_handler();
          DNS_time_handler();        
      }
  }
  ```

  Also, If you use a different MCU without using the RP2040, you need to change the **wizchip_1ms_timer_initialize** function in the 'RP2040-HAT-C/port/timer/timer.c' directory.

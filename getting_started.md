# Getting Started with Ethernet Examples

These sections will guide you through a series of steps from configuring development environment to running ethernet examples using the **WIZnet's ethernet products**.

## Development environment configuration

To test the ethernet examples, the development environment must be configured to use Raspberry Pi Pico.

The ethernet examples were tested by configuring the development environment for **Windows**. Please refer to the '**9.2. Building on MS Windows**' section of '**Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico**' document below and configure accordingly.

- [**Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico**][link-getting_started_with_raspberry_pi_pico]

**Visual Studio Code** was used during development and testing of ethernet examples, the guide document in each directory was prepared also base on development with Visual Studio Code. Please refer to corresponding document.

- **Add Cmake Configure Environment Value**

1. Open Cmake Tools Extension Settings
2. Add Cmake: Configure Environment Item as PICO_SDK_PATH
3. ADD Cmake: Configure Environment Valuse as 'D:/RP2040/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/pico-sdk'

## Hardware requirements

The ethernet examples use **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **WIZnet Ethernet HAT** - ethernet I/O module built on WIZnet's [**W5100S**][link-w5100s] ethernet chip or **W5100S-EVB-Pico** - ethernet I/O module built on [**RP2040**][link-rp2040] and WIZnet's [**W5100S**][link-w5100s] ethernet chip.

## Ethernet example structure

Examples are available at '**RP2040-HAT-C/examples/**' directory. As of now, following examples are provided.

- [**DHCP & DNS**][link-dhcp_dns]
- [**FTP**][link-ftp]
	- [**Client**][link-ftp_client]
	- [**Server**][link-ftp_server]
- [**HTTP**][link-http]
	- [**Server**][link-http_server]
- [**Loopback**][link-loopback]
- [**MQTT**][link-mqtt]
	- [**Publish**][link-mqtt_publish]
	- [**Subscribe**][link-mqtt_subscribe]
- [**SNTP**][link-sntp]
- [**TCP Client over SSL**][link-tcp_client_over_ssl]

Note that **ioLibrary_Driver**, **mbedtls**, **pico-sdk** are needed to run ethernet examples. 

1. **ioLibrary_Driver** library is applicable to WIZnet's W5x00 ethernet chip.

2. **mbedtls** library supports additional algorithms and support related to TLS and SSL connections. 

3. **pico-sdk** is made available by Pico to enable developers to build software applications for the Pico Platform.  

   Libraries are located in the '**RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/**' directory.

- [**ioLibrary_Driver**][link-ioLibrary_driver]

- [**mbedtls**][link-mbedtls_library]
- [**pico-sdk**][link-pico_sdk]

If you want to modify the code that MCU-dependent and use a MCU other than **RP2040**, you can modify it in the **port** directory.

port is located in the '**RP2040-HAT-C/port/**' directory.

- [**ioLibrary_Driver**][link-ioLibrary_driver_port]
- [**mbedtls**][link-mbedtls_port]
- [**timer**][link-timer_port]

The structure of this RP2040-HAT-C 2.0.0 version has changed a lot compared to the previous version. If you want to refer to the previous version, please refer to the link below.

- [**RP2040-HAT-C 1.0.0 version**][link-RP2040-HAT-C_1.0.0_version]

## Ethernet example testing

1. Download

If the ethernet examples are cloned, the library set as a submodule is an empty directory. Therefore, if you want to download the library set as a submodule together, clone the ethernet examples with the following Git command.

```cpp
/* Change directory */
// change to the directory to clone
cd [user path]

// e.g.
cd D:/RP2040

/* Clone */
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Wiznet/RP2040-HAT-C.git
```

With Visual Studio Code, the library set as a submodule is automatically downloaded, so it doesn't matter whether the library set as a submodule is an empty directory or not, so refer to it.

2. Patch

With Visual Studio Code, each library set as a submodule is automatically patched, but if you do not use Visual Studio Code, each library set as a submodule must be manually patched with the Git commands below in each library directory.

- ioLibrary_Driver

```cpp
/* Change directory */
// change to the 'ioLibrary_Driver' library directory
cd [user path]/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/ioLibrary_Driver

// e.g.
cd D:/RP2040/RP2040-HAT-C/libraries/ioLibrary_Driver

/* Patch */
git apply ../../patches/01_ethernet_chip.patch
git apply ../../patches/02_ftp_client.patch
```

3. Test

Please refer to 'README.md' in each example directory to find detail guide for testing ethernet examples.
